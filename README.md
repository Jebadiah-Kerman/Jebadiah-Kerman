### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**Jebadiah-Kerman/Jebadiah-Kerman** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a camera system to monitor foxes
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Rasberry pi coding
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my Toyota Corolla
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: carrier pigion 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/He
- âš¡ Fun fact: In 2019, I was banned from the Disney Springs Rainforest Cafe for 5 years for attempting to mud-wrestle the animatronic Crocodile
--> Its almost 2024, I'm coming for you Nile, and this time security won't be able to save you...
